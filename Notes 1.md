#  Notes 1
## 1, What is a transistor? 

Transistor is a semiconductor device used to amplify or switch electrical signals and power. The transistor is one of the basic building blocks of modern electronics. It is composed of semiconductor material, usually with at least three terminals for connection to an electronic circuit. A voltage or current applied to one pair of the transistor's terminals controls the current through another pair of terminals. Because the controlled (output) power can be higher than the controlling (input) power, a transistor can amplify a signal. Some transistors are packaged individually, but many more are found embedded in integrated circuits.

## 2, What Is Moore's Law?

Moore's Law states that the number of transistors on a microchip doubles every two years. The law claims that we can expect the speed and capability of our computers to increase every two years because of this, yet we will pay less for them. Another tenet of Moore's Law asserts that this growth is exponential. The law is attributed to Gordon Moore, the co-founder and former CEO of Intel.

## 3, What is lambda's calculus? 

Lambda calculus (also λ-calculus), introduced by Alonzo Church in the 1930s, is a model of computation based on functions. All functions in lambda calculus are anonymous, providing the inspiration for lambda expressions in modern programming languages. Lambda calculus is composed of only three elements: variables, function abstraction, and function application. Function abstraction is the process of defining a new function through a lambda (λ) expression. 

## 4, How do computers work? 

In short A computer, a digital information-processing machine, works by changing information into binary numbers (ones and zeros) and then using simple mathematics to make decisions about how to rearrange those numbers into words or actions. It takes information or data from one end, store it to process, and finally, after completing the processing, it output the result on the other hand. The information it takes at one end is known as Computer Input, and the result that it provides after processing is known as Computer Output.
